## About the Project Data Understanding

This exercise relates to the _data understanding_ and  _data preparation_ stages of the Crisp Data Mining (CRISP-DM) model presented on the Data Analysis and Machine Learning course.The project tries to address the below questions:

- Is the data quality sufficient?
- How can we check the data for problems?
- How do we have to clean the data?
- How is the data best transformed for modeling?


It may be tempting to just run a model on data without checking it. However, not doing basic checks can ruin your whole analysis and make your results invalid as well as mislead you in further analyses. There is no excuse for not plotting and checking that the data is as we expect and clean. In this exercise we do just that, check the validity of data and familiarize ourselves with a dataset, also discussing preprocessing and multi-dimensional plotting.


## Packages needed for this exercise:

The exercise project was done importing different useful packages and libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn  etc.

## Results

- The brief explanation of the analysis result has been described and answered in the exercises and clarified.

- Different analysis methods for standardized and non standardized data has been analyzed and described clearly.

- Different dimensionality reduction methods for Higher Dimentional data has been implemented and described like pca and t-sne.



## How to run the project

The project can be run by cloning this repository and after that the all the used  libraries needed to be installed. After installation the project can be run and output is visible as shown in the ipynb file.
